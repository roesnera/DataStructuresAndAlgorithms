steps to problem solving
1. understand the problem
	can I restate the problem in my own words?
	what are the inputs that go into the problem (data types, assumptions, number of inputs, etc)?
	what are the outputs that should come from this problem?
	Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
	How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
2. Explore concrete examples
	User stories!
	start with simple examples (input -> output)
	progress to more complex
	explore examples with empty inputs
	explore examples with invalid inputs
3. Break it down
	Write out explicit steps to solve the problem
4. Solve/simplify
	if you can't solve the problem, solve a simpler problem
	find the core difficulty
	temporarily ignore it
	return to the difficulty once the rest has been solved
	this process can be recursive
5. Look back and refactor
	can you check the result?
	can you derive the result differently?
	can you understand it at a glance?
	can you use the result or method for some other problem?
	can you improve the performance of your solution?
	can you think of other ways to refactor?
	how have other people solved this problem?
