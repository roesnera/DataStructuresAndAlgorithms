linear search
    - search each element in sequence
    - for unsorted data, this approach is not the absolute worst
    - in JS, .indexOf(), .includes(), .find(), and .findIndex() all work this way
    - works by visiting one item at a time, moving one index per iteration, and checking if it is the item that we are looking for
    - time complexity best: O(1), worst: O(n), average: O(n)
binary search
    - searches at the middle point of an array of elements
    - only works on sorted arrays!!!!
    - leverages the fact that the array is sorted by comparing the item being sought with the item at halfway
    -
