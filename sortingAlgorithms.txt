Sorting - the process of rearranging items in a collection so that they are ordered in a particular way.
requires a swap function in order to switch the items at given locations in an array upon comparison

JS Array.sort()
    - sorts according to String unicode code points
    - this means that sorting numbers gets real funky
    - ^ it will just sort by the first digit in a number as if it were a String
    - you can pass in a custom sorting algorithm
        - if your function returns a negative number, a should come before b
        - if your function returns a positive number, a should come after b
        - otherwise, a&b will be treated as sortable together


Bubble Sort
    - not all that efficient
    - not super common
    - sorting algorithm where larger items bubble up to the top
    - time complexity average: O(n^2), best O(n)
